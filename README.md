# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles, released daily throughout December.

## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles. This repository contains my solutions implemented in TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- TypeScript
- ts-node

## Structure

Each day's puzzle is organized by day and part:
- `src/<day>/<part>.ts` - Solution code for a specific day and part
- `input.txt` - The puzzle input files


## Running Solutions

```bash
npx ts-node .\src\<day>\<part>.ts
```

Example: `npx ts-node .\src\1\2.ts`

## Learnings

- Day One: I thought I understood Modulo...
- Day Two: Factor in a bit of trust that these are doable.
- Day Three: Part one 15 minutes, part two...1 day! Way over complicated it.
